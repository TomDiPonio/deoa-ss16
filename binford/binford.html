			<h3 class="mg-md">Early life/Biography</h3>
			<p> Lewis Binford was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia. Binford was not a very good student in high school, but afterwards, when he studied wildlife 
			biology at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he excelled greatly. Before deciding to pursue a biology career, Binford was drafted into the military for 
			World War II. Here he was assigned with a group of anthropologists whose job was to help resettle the people on the Pacific Islands under U.S. Control. He 
			also was part of the group that recovered lost archaeological material from the tombs in Okinawa with no training in excavation whatsoever. His time in the 
			military is what really sparked his interest in archaeology and anthropology.
